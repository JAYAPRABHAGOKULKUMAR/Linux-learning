**Introduction to Linux and Unix**

**What is an Operating System (OS)?**
An OS is software that manages computer hardware and resources. It allows users to interact with the computer and perform tasks.

**What is Unix?**
Unix is a family of operating systems developed in the 1960s at AT\&T Bell Labs.
It was first made for the PDP-7 computer and later rewritten in the C programming language, making it portable to different hardware.
Popular Unix-based systems include:

* Oracle Solaris
* OpenSolaris
* FreeBSD
* HPUX
* IBM AIX
* Apple macOS (based on BSD)

**What is Linux?**
Linux is a Unix-like family of open-source operating systems.
It was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds as a free alternative to Unix, built using tools from the GNU Project (1980s).
The Linux kernel is the core of the system and allows software to communicate with hardware.

**Key Features of Linux:**

* Free and open-source
* Multi-user support
* Multitasking capabilities
* Portable across many devices and platforms
* Very secure due to open development

**Linux History Highlights:**

* 1980s: GNU project begins at MIT
* 1991: Linus Torvalds releases the Linux kernel
* 1992: GNU tools and Linux kernel combined to form complete systems
* 1996: Tux the Penguin becomes the Linux mascot

**Where is Linux Used Today?**

* **Smartphones** (Android uses Linux kernel)
* **Supercomputers** (used for high-performance computing)
* **Cloud and enterprise servers** (web servers, databases, applications)
* **Desktops and laptops** (used by developers and enthusiasts)

**QUICK SUMMARY:**
Unix began in the 1960s and laid the foundation for many modern OSs.
Linux, developed in 1991, is a free and powerful Unix-like OS used across smartphones, servers, and PCs.
